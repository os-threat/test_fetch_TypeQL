# test_fetch_TypeQL
A simple repo to test the functionality of Fetch with Joshua

The aim is return all of these variations with a single query, across all of the id's

Everytime you run all of the cells, make sure you have a local copy of typedb (or set the connection object)

The id's will be generated each time, and so the TypeDB Studio queries at the bottom will also refresh

The logging is set to print out the Info statements into typedb.txt locally
# Note requires TypeDB v2.24 or earlier
